          <b> An Insight to Maharashtra Tourism</b>
          Vast, varied, vibrant and extremely vivacious - Maharashtra has a thing when it comes to urbanization and rapid development that is hard to find anywhere else in India. It's a paradisiacal paradox -subtle yet energetic; wild but manicured, and hushes yet fueled by rapid urbanization. Along with its stronghold on commercialism, Maharashtra is a winner in the category of tourism too.
